    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda </li>
        <li> ½ teaspoon salt </li>
        <li> ½ cup milk </li>
        <li> ½ cup vegetable oil </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract </li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar </li>
        <li> ½ cup butter </li>
        <li> 3 large eggs, room temperature </li>
        <li> red food coloring </li>
        <li>blue food coloring </li>
        <li> green food coloring </li>
        <li> yellow food coloring </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two 12-cup muffin pans with paper baking cups.  </li>
        <li> Stir together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk together milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla in a separate bowl until evenly blended; set aside. </li>
        <li> Beat sugar and butter with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. The mixture should be noticeably lighter in color. Add eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the butter mixture before adding the next. Pour in the flour mixture alternately with the milk mixture, mixing until just incorporated. </li>
        <li> Divide cake batter into four separate bowls. Add a few drops of food coloring into one bowl of batter and stir; add more food coloring if necessary to reach the desired shade. Repeat with remaining colors and bowls of batter. </li>
        <li> Using a different spoon for each color batter, spoon a small portion of each color into the cupcake liners, until 1/2 to 3/4 full. Do not mix the batter once it is in the cupcake liner. </li>
        <li> Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into a cupcake comes clean, 15 to 20 minutes. </li>
    </ol>
